# Mandeep_Java_Assignment_3
third assignment for java

I worked on these three-
1. Book an apppointment (required!)
  to make is simple, simply print the hours of operation and have the user select a Day of the week - write that into the User class
  you will need to add that property to the User class
2. fix/improve all PRINT statements! (with color as well, research)
3. add a validation method for the Book an appointment method/option/feature
